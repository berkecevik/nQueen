# nQueen

 This repository contains implementations of two approaches to solve the N-Queens problem: an Exhaustive Search Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

Project Structure
exhaustive.py: Contains the implementation of the exhaustive search algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem.
genetic.py: Implements a genetic algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem.
run_exhaustive.py: A script to execute the exhaustive algorithm for a specific board size and measure its performance.
run_genetic.py: A script to run the genetic algorithm on multiple board sizes and configurations, showcasing its performance and flexibility.
